# Abiquo Configuration Properties
#
# Abiquo configuration options are grouped in the file
# /opt/abiquo/config/abiquo.properties on each server of the Abiquo platform
# (Abiquo Server, Remote Services, V2V Services). The Abiquo Installer will
# create configuration files for your installation and example configuration
# To modify the configuration options, add the properties you wish to change
# to your abiquo.properties file and specify the new values.
# Below are all the configuration options that can be modified and their
# default values as set by Abiquo. The default values for properties are used
# within the Abiquo platform if you do not set the properties. However, some
# default configuration options may also be set outside of the Abiquo
# platform, for example, in the hypervisor. 
# After modifying this file, check carefully to ensure you have the correct
# values and no unnecessary whitespace around the properties. For the changes
# to take effect, restart the abiquo-tomcat service using "service
# abiquo-tomcat restart"
